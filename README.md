# MouseLock made by xk_rl

Mouselock is an application to lock the mouse to the center of the main screen. With a simple UI you can change things such as the LOCK/RELEASE button or the lock ROOT or things like a failsafe.

# Features as mentioned before
  - Lock the mouse to the center of the main screen
  - Change the root position of the lock
  - Change the LOCK/RELEASE button of the lock
  - When holding right click you can move your mouse freely but as soon as you release the right mouse button the mouse returns to its old position

# Additions
There are many more things i want to add such as the ability that when you right click that the mouse goes back to the root position of the initial right click position for third person cameras!

# Next Update
The next update will include following:
  - A better right click lock
  - Less CPU usage when idling, aiming to be about 5%-10% instead of the 25% now
  - 0% RAM usage or as close as we can get atleast
  - An option to swith from old right click lock now the new one
  - JSON FILES!! You can finally store your settings without having to redo everything
  - Mouse Lock update interval, you can basically now choose how fast your mouse refreshes every second

I will try my best to bring these new features as fast as possible! If i ever see that one would be impossible then i would delete that item from the list and implement it in another update.v

# Warning!
## This will not interfere with any ANTI-CHEAT but the risk is still there! Use it at your own risk i am not responsible for any damages or bans!
